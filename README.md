# zomboid-dedicated-helm
Helm chart for deploying Project Zomboid dedicated server

This is mostly catered to my setup. Very janky. Update your desired variables in values.yaml. Dedicated server is based on the container image [renegademaster/zomboid-dedicated-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/renegademaster/zomboid-dedicated-server)
